            <span>Stay at a ryokan and soak in an onsen, a volcanic hot spring bath</span>
            <p>A ryokan is a traditional Japanese inn featuring onsens with hot, mineral rich waters and traditional rooms with tatami mats. The first ryokan opened in 718 AD and has been a central part of Japanese culture ever since.
              Ryokans allow guests to relax in a homey and comfortable setting. Meals are served to you in your room Kaiseki style (multi-course Japanese dishes) while you wear traditional Yukata robes. Before or after your meal you can soak in the public onsens or book a private session. Public onsens are separated by gender since it's a nude experience. Some ryokans also feature private onsens in your room if you're up for the splurge.

            <span>Sing karaoke in Osaka</span>
            <p>Did you know that the first karaoke machine was invented in Japan in 1971? Karaoke parties are very popular in Japan, with more than 100,000 karaoke boxes and bars in the country. A karaoke box is a place where you can rent a private room with karaoke equipment and belt out songs with your friends.

              Our favourite karaoke bar we went to was Moonshine, a small alternative bar in Osaka (make sure to eat a hotdog there). Osaka's vibrant and zany appeal makes it a fun city to let loose and sing some karaoke!

          <span>Visit Hobbiton in New Zealand</span>
          <p>When Peter Jackson was searching for the perfect movie set location for the village of Hobbiton in The Lord of the Rings, he found it in New Zealand's rolling hillside located on the north island. The moment you step onto the sheep farm called Alexander Farm, it really feels like you've stepped into the movie.

            This specific farm had a remarkable resemblance to how JRR Tolkein described The Shire. The small details crafted into the movie set really allow your imagination to run wild as you think about what real life would have been like in Hobbiton.
            
            Many people associate The Lord of the Rings with New Zealand and it has made a big impact on the country's tourism ever since the movies were released in 2001.

            <span>Stay at a nomadic yurt camp to see how Kyrgyz nomads live</span>
            <p>The quintessential Kyrgyzstan experience is staying in a nomadic yurt. Up in the alpine around 3,000m you will find shepherd yurt camps where Kyrgyz people live and graze their livestock. The best way to access these places is to do as the Kyrgyz people do and hop on a horse. You will see first hand how this animal plays an essential role in their culture.  

              Our favourite yurt camp was Jyrgal's Yurt Camp in Kel-Suu. Since the area is so remote, we got our own private yurt. At night time you won't believe how bright the stars are. If your guide offers you kumis (fermented horse milk) in a nomadic initiation, make sure to take it on your last day as the toilet might be your next destination.
